This repository contains files that I captured (duh, what did you expect? Another F0 repo with same files over and over? xD)

## Bad USB

Currently divided into 3 categories, with more to come (maybe).
- Annoyance - Basically for annoying your friends
- ASCII - Classic ASCII art
- Misc - Either stuff waiting to be sorted or stuff that would have an entire category for itself (```Show_WiFi_Passwords.txt``` isn't mine, but its so good I had to include it)

## Infrared

Mainly I have "harvested" remotes I have found at home, currently there are saved 5 remotes in over 10 files (i guess, I'm not really a math guy).
The reason for having more files than remotes is that one remote can control multiple devices. This is because of sorting by ```Catergory``` > ```Brand```  > ```Model```,and my preference is to have one file per model, primarily for easier management and to keep file names as short as possible

## SubGHz

There isn't much here, except for one cloned remote with 3 actions used at Dinopark Cinema in Prague (I worked there, and I wanted to test my new flipper by copying it. Don't judge me; I just wanted to have some fun).

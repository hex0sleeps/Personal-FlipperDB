This repository contains files that I captured (duh, what did you expect? Another F0 repo with same files over and over? xD)

## Bad USB

Divides for now in 3 categories, more to come (maybe).
- Annoyance - Basically for annoying friends
- ASCII - Classic ASCII art
- Misc - Either stuff waiting to be sorted or stuff that would have an entire category for itself (```Show_WiFi_Passwords.txt``` isn't mine, but its so good I had to include it)

## Infrared

Mainly I have "milked" remotes I have found at home, currently there are saved 5 remotes in over 10 files (i guess, I'm not really a math guy).
Now, the reason for having more files than remotes is that one remote can control more devices and because of sorting by ```Catergory``` > ```Brand```  > ```Model``` I don't want to have one file with more models (mainly because of file name length).

## SubGHz

There is nothing much, except for one cloned remote with 3 action in Dinopark Cinema at Prague (I worked there, I wanted to try copy it. Don't judge me I wanted to have some fun).

This repository contains mainly files that I have captured (what did you expect? Another F0 repo with same files over and over?)

## BadUSB

Currently divided into 3 categories, with more to come (maybe).
- Annoyance - Basically for annoying your friends
- ASCII - Classic ASCII art
- Misc - Either stuff waiting to be sorted or stuff that would have an entire category for itself (```Show_WiFi_Passwords.txt``` isn't mine, but I like it so much, that I just had to include it)

### BadUSB-resources

Really just place store text/art that has to be typed out as part of script, but cannot be in normal "STRING" way (for example you cannot type out braille or boxes, or anything outside of the basic ASCII range using the Alt key).

## Infrared

Mainly I have "harvested" remotes I have found at home or at school (for projector(s)). Now there are about 15 remotes (i guess, I'm not really a math guy).
The reason for having more files with same "code" is that one remote can control multiple devices. This is because of sorting by ```Category``` > ```Brand```  > ```Model```, and my preference is to have one file per model, primarily for easier management and to keep file names as short as possible. Having file with 7 model names would be obnoxious (also Windows might not like it with the character limit).

## SubGHz

This might be the smallest Sub-GHz repo for Flippers, but y'know - something is still more than nothing. To sum it up there is one cloned remote with 3 actions used at Dinopark Cinema in Prague where I worked and alarm disabler for Škoda from '87-'90.
